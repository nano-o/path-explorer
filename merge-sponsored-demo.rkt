; Here the goal is to test various scenarios in which an account is merged with another account and there are some sponsorhip relationships involved.
; The tests will consist of a single ACCOUNT_MERGE operation.
; The variable part of the test is the ledger state in which this operation is applied and the contents of the ACCOUNT_MERGE operation.

; NOTE: see Stellar-overrides.rkt for constraints on array sizes (e.g. num signers is set to 1)

; First, we establish some base assumptions.
