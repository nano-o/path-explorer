#lang rosette/safe

; Goal: develop a basic model of transaction processing in Stellar.
; The model should be sufficient to generate tests for the create-account and payment operations.
; Also, develop a test harness that can take test inputs generated here and run them against the C++ implementation.

; TODO maybe we should stick to operations and exclude transactions
