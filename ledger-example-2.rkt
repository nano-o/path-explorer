#lang rosette/safe

; Goal: develop a basic model of transaction processing in Stellar.
; The model should be sufficient to generate tests for the create-account and payment operations.
; Also, develop a test harness that can take test inputs generated here and run them against the C++ implementation.

; TODO maybe we should stick to operations and exclude transactions

; TODO generate data model from XDR?

; In the functional-relational approach, we use uninterpreted functions (to boolean, for relations) as much as possible because they are solvable types in Rosette
; One issue is that this will be very verbose. It would be nice to use a notation like in Alloy
; we have the following types of entries: account, trustline, offer, data, claimable-balance, and liquidity-pool
